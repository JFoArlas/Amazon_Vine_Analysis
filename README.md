# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there was any bias towards Amazon reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. Utlimately, we wanted to determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews for a given type of product.

## Results
- There were 21 total Vine reviews vs. 6,690 total non-Vine reviews.

## Summary: In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
The sample size of the Vine reviews (i.e. the reviews that were paid) was very small relative to the non-Vine (i.e. unpaid) reviews. So while there is not a higher percentage of 5-star reviews when the review is paid, we cannot definitively say that paid reviews do not result any positivity bias.

If you were to take the average star for both Vine and non-Vine reviews, you find that the average rating is actually higher for paid reviews by almost a full half star. So while our review data does not reflect more 5-star ratings for paid reviews, one could suspect that paid reviews do result in some positivity bias in terms of the average rating. That said, because our sample size is so small for paid reviews, I would not definitively conclude that without more data.
